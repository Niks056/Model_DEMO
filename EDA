Variable Identification
a. Numeric
  1. Int 
  2. Float
b. Categorical Variables
  1. Nominal --> One_hot encoding
  2. Ordinal-- > Label Encoding
  3. Binary
c. DateType Columns
  
 Univariate Analysis:
 1. Numeric: (Line charts,Histogram,Boxplots)
    a. mean
    b. mode
    c. median
    d. min
    e. max
    f. std
    g. IQR
2. Categorical:(Bar charts)
  a. No of unique categories in column
  b. Value_counts of unique categories of column
  
Bi-variate Analysos:
1. Continous and Continous--> Correlation
2. Category and Continous --> 
  Anova -->  whether the means of more than two groups are statiscally different from each other.
  T-test --> whether the means of two groups are statiscally diff from each other (when population variance is not known and sample size <= 30 )
  Z-test --> whether the means of two groups are statiscally diff from each other (when population variance is known and sample size > 30)
3. Category and Category(Ordinal) -->(Stacked Column Chart) Chi-Square 
   0: Both the Categorical variables are dependent
   1: Both the Categorical Variables are independent
   Category and Category(Nominal) --> Cramers V- Rule
